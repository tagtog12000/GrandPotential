# GrandPotential
Grand potentiel (Free energy) in finit temperature many-body perturbation theory.

A new program created in C/C++ language generates automatically the analytic expression of grand potential and prints it in Latex2e format and in textual data. 
Another code created in Mathematica language can translate the textual data into a mathematical expression (fractions) and help any interested to evaluate the thermodynamic quantities in analytic or numeric forms at arbitrary order.
